My favorite way to learn something is to figure out what the best people are doing and copy them. Learning itself, especially while young, involves a lot of copying. Language acquisition is a combination of pattern recognition and copying. Novice chefs, in both homes and restaurants, learn and copy recipes before taking the risk of innovation. By copying others practices, especially the practices of top performers, we lay foundations that allow us to perform at top levels. 

This is a core concept of education. Someone who wants to learn how to calculate the area of triangle could discover mathematical and geometrical truths on their own, or they could crack open an elementary level math book. This would save them quite a bit of time, and provide them with quick knowledge of the most efficient way to do something.

This principle is why I love both Flatiron and Codewars. At Flatiron, I am taught best practices right off the bat. There are many ways to solve a problem with code, and many ways to organize that code. If they will all accomplish the same thing, my primary concern is the most efficient or highest performing methodology. "You need to know the rules before you can break them" is a phrase I like. You must understand the fundamentals, the best practices, and why they are so, before you can innovate and improve on top of them. To forgo this understanding is arrogant, it assumes that a novice somehow knows more than seasoned experts.

With Codewars, I get to solve Ruby problems with my own code. All that matters is that I get the tests to pass. It's fun, and a great way to learn both Ruby and how to think while coding. On top of that, I am shown the most upvoted code (upon completion of the problem) for both cleverness and best practices. Fast and continuous exposure to best practices via code wars has helped me write cleaner, more efficient code.

Not long ago, copying the correct was not so easy. Two innovations in history, books, and the internet, have made the greatest advances in allowing people to copy the correct. Thanks to the internet, I almost always have instant access to information about what the top people in anything do or think. I'm thankful for that.
