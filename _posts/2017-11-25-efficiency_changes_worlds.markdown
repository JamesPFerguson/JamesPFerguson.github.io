Efficiency is the foundation of prosperity. The great inventions of history made previously difficult, important, and lengthy tasks easy and short. The printing press, the mechanical reaper, the plow, the tractor, the automobile, the train, the plane, the calculator, the computer, the cell phone, the smart phone. Each previously listed tool has saved humanity an unbelievable amount of time. Traveling long distances was once dangerous and slow. Today, I can fly from North Carolina to California in 5 hours. Things that were once luxuries can be enjoyed by almost anyone thanks to the slow march forward of technology.

I care deeply about technology and programming because of it's capability to increase efficiency. It makes me happy to know that every task automated, every task made more efficient, is drudgery eliminated in someone's life, is wealth created, is something made more affordable. I constantly feel thankful for the luxuries of modernity made common and affordable by increased efficiency. Temperature controlled houses with refrigeration, electricity, a stove (which does not require logs and fire, but for me to simply rotate a knob), a heated shower, and instant access to all the worlds information and a lot of its people. Most people living in the U.S. experience a quality of life that would make John Rockefeller jealous. In the next 100 years, I hope to see a similar amount of progress. That's why programming appeals to me.
