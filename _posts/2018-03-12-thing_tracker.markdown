I moved houses recently. Things packed were easy to forget about. What box was the lamp in? What room is that box even in? Is the box at the old house or the new house? A database seemed like a good solution for all this.

Thing Tracker has user accounts, which can only see and modify their own entries. Users can add buildings, which can have many rooms, which can have many containers, which can have many things. Things belong to containers, containers belong to rooms, and so on.

While it wasn't required for the project, I implemented a search feature on the user homepage so that users can easily find their containers and things. I also added a navbar and lots of links, which made the project quicker to navigate while testing it out.

I coded the majority of the project in two days, with two more days of light work being necessary for fixing broken code and making sure that weird errors couldn't happen.
